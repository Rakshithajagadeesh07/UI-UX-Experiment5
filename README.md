## Aim:

To understand and apply the process of identifying user experience (UX) problems, selecting appropriate research methods, and developing user personas for different project scenarios such as a health & fitness app and an e-government service portal.

## Algorithm:

#### STEP 1 : Understand the Scenario:
Analyze the given UX design problem (e.g., health app or e-government portal) to identify the target users and their main goals.

#### STEP 2 : Identify User Pain Points:
Collect common issues faced by users while using similar existing systems or applications.

#### STEP 3 : Write UX Problem Statements:
Use the standard template —
"User" needs a way to achieve goal because "obstacle", which results in "impact" .

#### STEP 4 : Select Research Methods:
Choose appropriate user research methods such as interviews, surveys, usability testing, or heuristic evaluation, based on the nature of the problem.

#### STEP 5 : Justify Method Selection:
Explain why each chosen method is suitable for understanding user behavior and improving design solutions.

#### STEP 6 : Create User Personas:
Based on data or realistic assumptions, define at least two personas for each scenario including demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, motivations, and quotes.

#### STEP 7 : Summarize Findings:
Conclude by connecting the problem statements, research methods, and personas to demonstrate how they guide user-centered design decisions.
