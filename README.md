## Aim:

To understand and apply the process of identifying user experience (UX) problems, selecting appropriate research methods, and developing user personas for different project scenarios such as a health & fitness app and an e-government service portal.

## Algorithm:

#### STEP 1 : Understand the Scenario:
Analyze the given UX design problem (e.g., health app or e-government portal) to identify the target users and their main goals.

#### STEP 2 : Identify User Pain Points:
Collect common issues faced by users while using similar existing systems or applications.

#### STEP 3 : Write UX Problem Statements:
Use the standard template —
"User" needs a way to achieve goal because "obstacle", which results in "impact" .

#### STEP 4 : Select Research Methods:
Choose appropriate user research methods such as interviews, surveys, usability testing, or heuristic evaluation, based on the nature of the problem.

#### STEP 5 : Justify Method Selection:
Explain why each chosen method is suitable for understanding user behavior and improving design solutions.

#### STEP 6 : Create User Personas:
Based on data or realistic assumptions, define at least two personas for each scenario including demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, motivations, and quotes.

#### STEP 7 : Summarize Findings:
Conclude by connecting the problem statements, research methods, and personas to demonstrate how they guide user-centered design decisions.

### Scenario 1: Health & Fitness Tracking App

##### 1. Problem Statement

###### Background 

Health consciousness is rising among young professionals, yet maintaining fitness routines is 
difficult due to busy schedules and lifestyle constraints. Although many apps exist, users 
often stop using them because of confusing layouts, irrelevant features, and poor motivation 
systems. 

###### User Pain Points 

● Users struggle to maintain consistency in tracking workouts and meals. 

● Most fitness apps are cluttered and packed with unnecessary features. 

● Dashboards are overly complex, making progress tracking difficult. 

● Syncing issues between devices cause inaccurate or lost data. 

● Users receive too many notifications, reducing engagement. 

###### UX Problem Statement (Template) 

"Health-conscious users need a way to easily track and visualize their daily fitness and diet 
progress because current apps are complex and non-personalized, which results in reduced 
motivation, inconsistent usage, and loss of interest." 

###### Design Goal 

To design a simple, motivating, and personalized fitness tracking app that helps users 
maintain healthy habits through intuitive navigation, adaptive reminders, and clear progress 
visualization.
